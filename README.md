# Chiffre-de-Vigenere
<p align = \"center\">A program for encrypting and decrypting text using the Vigenere method.<br>
                        It is possible to choose the alphabet and the key. <br>
                        The text can be single or multiline. If the text has several lines, 
                        a line feed character is added to the alphabet when encrypting. 
                        When decrypting text with multiple lines, you must select the checkbox "line break".
                        This item will add a line break character to the alphabet, if there was no such 
                        a character in it. If you deselect this option, the line break character will be 
                        removed from the current alphabet.</p>
                        <p align="justify">To see all the characters of the current alphabet, 
                        press the "Set alphabet" button. To keep it unchanged, press "Cancel".</p>
                        <p align="justify">With this program you can try to decode the text encoded by 
                        the Vigenere cipher or its special case - the Caesar cipher. 
                        To decrypt it, you must have a text of at least 500 characters long, you must know 
                        the alphabet and the length of the key.</p>
                        <p align="justify">Procedure for breaking the cipher:
                        <ol>
                        <li>Place the encrypted text in the upper text field.</li>
                        <li> Press the "Set alphabet" button and enter the current alphabet.</li>
                        <li> Press the "Crack key tools" button and enter the length of the key. </li>
                        <li> In the pop-up dialog box you can check the current alphabet. Press "OK".</li>
                        <li> In the lower text box the decryption variant will appear, and in the "Key" 
                        box the current key variant will appear.</li></ol>
                        If the decryption is unsuccessful, you can change the order of characters in the alphabet,
                        the alphabet itself and the length of the key until the result is satisfactory.</p>
